/**
 * React Query key factory for user-defined tables.
 *
 * Lives in this standalone (non-`'use client'`) module — like
 * {@link file://./folder-keys.ts} — so it can be imported from server
 * components (e.g. the tables page prefetch) without pulling in the
 * `'use client'` `@/hooks/queries/tables` module, whose exports would
 * otherwise resolve to client-reference stubs on the server.
