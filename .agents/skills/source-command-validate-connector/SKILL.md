# source-command-validate-connector

Use this skill when the user asks to run the migrated source command `validate-connector`.

## Command Template

# Validate Connector Skill

You are an expert auditor for Sim knowledge base connectors. Your job is to thoroughly validate that an existing connector is correct, complete, and follows all conventions.

## Your Task

When the user asks you to validate a connector:
1. Read the service's API documentation (via Context7 or WebFetch)
2. Read the connector implementation, OAuth config, and registry entries
3. Cross-reference everything against the API docs and Sim conventions
4. Report all issues found, grouped by severity (critical, warning, suggestion)
5. Fix all issues after reporting them

## Step 1: Gather All Files

Read **every** file for the connector — do not skip any:

```
apps/sim/connectors/{service}/meta.ts        # ConnectorMeta — client-safe metadata (icon, name, auth, configFields, tagDefinitions)
apps/sim/connectors/{service}/{service}.ts   # Connector implementation — spreads the meta + runtime functions
apps/sim/connectors/{service}/index.ts       # Barrel export
apps/sim/connectors/registry.server.ts       # Server-only full registry entry (CONNECTOR_REGISTRY; full connector)
apps/sim/connectors/registry.ts              # Client-safe meta registry entry (CONNECTOR_META_REGISTRY)
apps/sim/connectors/types.ts                 # ConnectorMeta / ConnectorConfig interfaces, ExternalDocument, etc.
apps/sim/connectors/utils.ts                 # Shared utilities (computeContentHash, htmlToPlainText, etc.)
apps/sim/lib/oauth/oauth.ts                  # OAUTH_PROVIDERS — single source of truth for scopes
apps/sim/lib/oauth/utils.ts                  # getCanonicalScopesForProvider, getScopesForService, SCOPE_DESCRIPTIONS
apps/sim/lib/oauth/types.ts                  # OAuthService union type
apps/sim/components/icons.tsx                 # Icon definition for the service
```

If the connector uses selectors, also read:
```
apps/sim/hooks/selectors/registry.ts         # Selector key definitions
apps/sim/hooks/selectors/types.ts            # SelectorKey union type
apps/sim/lib/workflows/subblocks/context.ts  # SELECTOR_CONTEXT_FIELDS
```

## Step 2: Pull API Documentation

Fetch the official API docs for the service. This is the **source of truth** for:
- Endpoint URLs, HTTP methods, and auth headers
- Required vs optional parameters
- Parameter types and allowed values
- Response shapes and field names
- Pagination patterns (cursor, offset, next token)
- Rate limits and error formats
- OAuth scopes and their meanings

Use Context7 (resolve-library-id → query-docs) or WebFetch to retrieve documentation. If both fail, note which claims are based on training knowledge vs verified docs.

## Step 3: Validate API Endpoints

For **every** API call in the connector (`listDocuments`, `getDocument`, `validateConfig`, and any helper functions), verify against the API docs:

### URLs and Methods
- [ ] Base URL is correct for the service's API version
- [ ] Endpoint paths match the API docs exactly
- [ ] HTTP method is correct (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- [ ] Path parameters are correctly interpolated and URI-encoded where needed
- [ ] Query parameters use correct names and formats per the API docs

### Headers
- [ ] Authorization header uses the correct format:
  - OAuth: `Authorization: Bearer ${accessToken}`
  - API Key: correct header name per the service's docs
- [ ] `Content-Type` is set for POST/PUT/PATCH requests
- [ ] Any service-specific headers are present (e.g., `Notion-Version`, `Dropbox-API-Arg`)
- [ ] No headers are sent that the API doesn't support or silently ignores

### Request Bodies
- [ ] POST/PUT body fields match API parameter names exactly
- [ ] Required fields are always sent
- [ ] Optional fields are conditionally included (not sent as `null` or empty unless the API expects that)
- [ ] Field value types match API expectations (string vs number vs boolean)

### Input Sanitization
- [ ] User-controlled values interpolated into query strings are properly escaped:
  - OData `$filter`: single quotes escaped with `''` (e.g., `externalId.replace(/'/g, "''")`)
  - SOQL: single quotes escaped with `\'`
  - GraphQL variables: passed as variables, not interpolated into query strings
  - URL path segments: `encodeURIComponent()` applied
- [ ] URL-type config fields (e.g., `siteUrl`, `instanceUrl`) are normalized:
  - Strip `https://` / `http://` prefix if the API expects bare domains
  - Strip trailing `/`
  - Apply `.trim()` before validation

### Response Parsing
- [ ] Response structure is correctly traversed (e.g., `data.results` vs `data.items` vs `data`)
- [ ] Field names extracted match what the API actually returns
- [ ] Nullable fields are handled with `?? null` or `|| undefined`
- [ ] Error responses are checked before accessing data fields

## Step 4: Validate OAuth Scopes (if OAuth connector)

Scopes must be correctly declared and sufficient for all API calls the connector makes.

### Connector requiredScopes
- [ ] `requiredScopes` in the connector's `auth` config lists all scopes needed by the connector
- [ ] Each scope in `requiredScopes` is a real, valid scope recognized by the service's API
- [ ] No invalid, deprecated, or made-up scopes are listed
- [ ] No unnecessary excess scopes beyond what the connector actually needs

### Scope Subset Validation (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Every scope in `requiredScopes` exists in the OAuth provider's `scopes` array in `lib/oauth/oauth.ts`
- [ ] Find the provider in `OAUTH_PROVIDERS[providerGroup].services[serviceId].scopes`
- [ ] Verify: `requiredScopes` ⊆ `OAUTH_PROVIDERS scopes` (every required scope is present in the provider config)
- [ ] If a required scope is NOT in the provider config, flag as **critical** — the connector will fail at runtime

### Scope Sufficiency
For each API endpoint the connector calls:
- [ ] Identify which scopes are required per the API docs
- [ ] Verify those scopes are included in the connector's `requiredScopes`
- [ ] If the connector calls endpoints requiring scopes not in `requiredScopes`, flag as **warning**

### Token Refresh Config
- [ ] Check the `getOAuthTokenRefreshConfig` function in `lib/oauth/oauth.ts` for this provider
- [ ] `useBasicAuth` matches the service's token exchange requirements
- [ ] `supportsRefreshTokenRotation` matches whether the service issues rotating refresh tokens
- [ ] Token endpoint URL is correct

## Step 5: Validate Pagination

### listDocuments Pagination
- [ ] Cursor/pagination parameter name matches the API docs
- [ ] Response pagination field is correctly extracted (e.g., `next_cursor`, `nextPageToken`, `@odata.nextLink`, `offset`)
- [ ] `hasMore` is correctly determined from the response
- [ ] `nextCursor` is correctly passed back for the next page
- [ ] `maxItems` / `maxRecords` cap is correctly applied across pages using `syncContext.totalDocsFetched`
- [ ] Page size is within the API's allowed range (not exceeding max page size)
- [ ] Last page precision: when a `maxItems` cap exists, the final page request uses `Math.min(PAGE_SIZE, remaining)` to avoid fetching more records than needed
- [ ] No off-by-one errors in pagination tracking
- [ ] The connector does NOT hit known API pagination limits silently (e.g., HubSpot search 10k cap)

### Deletion-Reconciliation Safety (`listingCapped`) — CRITICAL
The sync engine hard-deletes any stored document absent from a full listing. Audit every path where `listDocuments` can return less than the full source set:
- [ ] `syncContext.listingCapped = true` is set when a `maxItems`-style cap truncates the listing while more documents exist
- [ ] `listingCapped` is set when a transient per-item error drops a still-existing document from the listing
- [ ] `listingCapped` is NOT set when the source is genuinely exhausted (deleted documents must reconcile) or for intentional scope filters (date cutoffs)
This is the most common connector bug class — verify it explicitly against `sync-engine.ts`'s reconciliation gate.

### Pagination State Across Pages
- [ ] `syncContext` is used to cache state across pages (user names, field maps, instance URLs, portal IDs, etc.)
- [ ] Cached state in `syncContext` is correctly initialized on first page and reused on subsequent pages

## Step 6: Validate Data Transformation

### ExternalDocument Construction
- [ ] `externalId` is a stable, unique identifier from the source API
- [ ] `title` is extracted from the correct field and has a sensible fallback (e.g., `'Untitled'`)
- [ ] `content` is plain text — HTML content is stripped using `htmlToPlainText` from `@/connectors/utils`
- [ ] `mimeType` is `'text/plain'`
- [ ] `contentHash` is metadata-based for contentDeferred connectors (a string template like `service:${id}:${changeIndicator}`, identical between the `listDocuments` stub and `getDocument`); content-based via `computeContentHash` from `@/connectors/utils` ONLY when `listDocuments` returns full content inline
- [ ] `sourceUrl` is a valid, complete URL back to the original resource (not relative)
- [ ] `metadata` contains all fields referenced by `mapTags` and `tagDefinitions`

### Content Extraction
- [ ] Rich text / HTML fields are converted to plain text before indexing
- [ ] Important content is not silently dropped (e.g., nested blocks, table cells, code blocks)
- [ ] Content is not silently truncated without logging a warning
- [ ] Empty/blank documents are properly filtered out
- [ ] Size checks use `Buffer.byteLength(text, 'utf8')` not `text.length` when comparing against byte-based limits (e.g., `MAX_FILE_SIZE` in bytes)

## Step 7: Validate Tag Definitions and mapTags

### tagDefinitions
- [ ] Each `tagDefinition` has an `id`, `displayName`, and `fieldType`
- [ ] `fieldType` matches the actual data type: `'text'` for strings, `'number'` for numbers, `'date'` for dates, `'boolean'` for booleans
- [ ] Every `id` in `tagDefinitions` is returned by `mapTags`
- [ ] No `tagDefinition` references a field that `mapTags` never produces

### mapTags
- [ ] Return keys match `tagDefinition` `id` values exactly
- [ ] Date values are properly parsed using `parseTagDate` from `@/connectors/utils`
- [ ] Array values are properly joined using `joinTagArray` from `@/connectors/utils`
- [ ] Number values are validated (not `NaN`)
- [ ] Metadata field names accessed in `mapTags` match what `listDocuments`/`getDocument` store in `metadata`

## Step 8: Validate Config Fields and Validation

### configFields
- [ ] Every field has `id`, `title`, `type`
- [ ] `required` is set explicitly (not omitted)
- [ ] Dropdown fields have `options` with `label` and `id` for each option
- [ ] Selector fields follow the canonical pair pattern:
  - A `type: 'selector'` field with `selectorKey`, `canonicalParamId`, `mode: 'basic'`
  - A `type: 'short-input'` field with the same `canonicalParamId`, `mode: 'advanced'`
  - `required` is identical on both fields in the pair
- [ ] `selectorKey` values exist in the selector registry
- [ ] `dependsOn` references selector field `id` values, not `canonicalParamId`

### validateConfig
- [ ] Validates all required fields are present before making API calls
- [ ] Validates optional numeric fields (checks `Number.isNaN`, positive values)
- [ ] Makes a lightweight API call to verify access (e.g., fetch 1 record, get profile)
- [ ] Uses `VALIDATE_RETRY_OPTIONS` for retry budget
- [ ] Returns `{ valid: true }` on success
- [ ] Returns `{ valid: false, error: 'descriptive message' }` on failure
- [ ] Catches exceptions and returns user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Does NOT make expensive calls (full data listing, large queries)

## Step 9: Validate getDocument

- [ ] Fetches a single document by `externalId`
- [ ] Returns `null` for 404 / not found (does not throw)
- [ ] Returns the same `ExternalDocument` shape as `listDocuments`
- [ ] Handles all content types that `listDocuments` can produce (e.g., if `listDocuments` returns both pages and blogposts, `getDocument` must handle both — not hardcode one endpoint)
- [ ] Forwards `syncContext` if it needs cached state (user names, field maps, etc.)
- [ ] Error handling is graceful (catches, logs, returns null or throws with context)
- [ ] Does not redundantly re-fetch data already included in the initial API response (e.g., if comments come back with the post, don't fetch them again separately)

## Step 10: Validate General Quality

### fetchWithRetry Usage
- [ ] All external API calls use `fetchWithRetry` from `@/lib/knowledge/documents/utils`
- [ ] No raw `fetch()` calls to external APIs
- [ ] `VALIDATE_RETRY_OPTIONS` used in `validateConfig`
- [ ] If `validateConfig` calls a shared helper (e.g., `linearGraphQL`, `resolveId`), that helper must accept and forward `retryOptions` to `fetchWithRetry`
- [ ] Default retry options used in `listDocuments`/`getDocument`

### API Efficiency
- [ ] APIs that support field selection (e.g., `$select`, `sysparm_fields`, `fields`) should request only the fields the connector needs — in both `listDocuments` AND `getDocument`
- [ ] No redundant API calls: if a helper already fetches data (e.g., site metadata), callers should reuse the result instead of making a second call for the same information
- [ ] Sequential per-item API calls (fetching details for each document in a loop) should be batched with `Promise.all` and a concurrency limit of 3-5

### Error Handling
- [ ] Individual document failures are caught and logged without aborting the sync
- [ ] API error responses include status codes in error messages
- [ ] No unhandled promise rejections in concurrent operations

### Concurrency
- [ ] Concurrent API calls use reasonable batch sizes (3-5 is typical)
- [ ] No unbounded `Promise.all` over large arrays

### Logging
- [ ] Uses `createLogger` from `@sim/logger` (not `console.log`)
- [ ] Logs sync progress at `info` level
- [ ] Logs errors at `warn` or `error` level with context

### Meta / Runtime Split
- [ ] `connectors/{service}/meta.ts` exports `{service}ConnectorMeta: ConnectorMeta` (id, name, description, version, icon, auth, configFields, and any `tagDefinitions` / `supportsIncrementalSync`)
- [ ] `meta.ts` imports ONLY the icon from `@/components/icons`, `ConnectorMeta` (type-only), and pure-data constants — NO server/runtime imports (`@/lib/knowledge/...`, `input-validation.server`, `fetchWithRetry`, etc.); any such import in `meta.ts` is **critical** (breaks the client bundle)
- [ ] `connectors/{service}/{service}.ts` spreads `...{service}ConnectorMeta` as the first property and adds the runtime functions (`listDocuments`, `getDocument`, `validateConfig`, `mapTags?`)
- [ ] Metadata fields (id, name, auth, configFields, etc.) live ONLY in `meta.ts`, not duplicated in `{service}.ts`

### Registry
- [ ] Connector is exported from `connectors/{service}/index.ts`
- [ ] Full connector is registered in `connectors/registry.server.ts` (server-only registry, `CONNECTOR_REGISTRY`)
- [ ] Meta is registered in `connectors/registry.ts` (client-safe registry, `CONNECTOR_META_REGISTRY`), importing `@/connectors/{service}/meta`
- [ ] Both registries use the same key and it matches the connector's `id` field
- [ ] Both registries keep the same alphabetical-by-id ordering

## Step 11: Report and Fix

### Report Format

Group findings by severity:

**Critical** (will cause runtime errors, data loss, or auth failures):
- Wrong API endpoint URL or HTTP method
- Invalid or missing OAuth scopes (not in provider config)
- Incorrect response field mapping (accessing wrong path)
- SOQL/query fields that don't exist on the target object
- Pagination that silently hits undocumented API limits
- Missing error handling that would crash the sync
- `requiredScopes` not a subset of OAuth provider scopes
- Query/filter injection: user-controlled values interpolated into OData `$filter`, SOQL, or query strings without escaping
- Server/runtime import in `meta.ts` (e.g. `@/lib/knowledge/...`, `input-validation.server`, `fetchWithRetry`) — pulls server-only code into the client bundle and breaks the build
- Connector missing from `connectors/registry.ts` (the client-safe meta registry) — or its entry there imports the runtime module instead of `meta.ts` — the knowledge UI can't render it

**Warning** (incorrect behavior, data quality issues, or convention violations):
- HTML content not stripped via `htmlToPlainText`
- `getDocument` not forwarding `syncContext`
- `getDocument` hardcoded to one content type when `listDocuments` returns multiple (e.g., only pages but not blogposts)
- Missing `tagDefinition` for metadata fields returned by `mapTags`
- Incorrect `useBasicAuth` or `supportsRefreshTokenRotation` in token refresh config
- Invalid scope names that the API doesn't recognize (even if silently ignored)
- Private resources excluded from name-based lookup despite scopes being available
- Silent data truncation without logging
- `contentHash` uses the wrong basis: a content-based `computeContentHash` on a contentDeferred connector (breaks the stub/getDocument-identical invariant), or a metadata template when `listDocuments` returns full content inline
- Size checks using `text.length` (character count) instead of `Buffer.byteLength` (byte count) for byte-based limits
- URL-type config fields not normalized (protocol prefix, trailing slashes cause API failures)
- `VALIDATE_RETRY_OPTIONS` not threaded through helper functions called by `validateConfig`

**Suggestion** (minor improvements):
- Missing incremental sync support despite API supporting it
- Overly broad scopes that could be narrowed (not wrong, but could be tighter)
- Source URL format could be more specific
- Missing `orderBy` for deterministic pagination
- Redundant API calls that could be cached in `syncContext`
- Sequential per-item API calls that could be batched with `Promise.all` (concurrency 3-5)
- API supports field selection but connector fetches all fields (e.g., missing `$select`, `sysparm_fields`, `fields`)
- `getDocument` re-fetches data already included in the initial API response (e.g., comments returned with post)
- Last page of pagination requests full `PAGE_SIZE` when fewer records remain (`Math.min(PAGE_SIZE, remaining)`)

### Fix All Issues

After reporting, fix every **critical** and **warning** issue. Apply **suggestions** where they don't add unnecessary complexity.

### Validation Output

After fixing, confirm:
1. `bun run lint` passes
2. TypeScript compiles clean
3. Re-read all modified files to verify fixes are correct
