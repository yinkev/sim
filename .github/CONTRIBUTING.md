# Contributing to Sim

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Sim! Our goal is to provide developers with a powerful, user-friendly platform for building, testing, and optimizing agentic workflows. We welcome contributions in all forms—from bug fixes and design improvements to brand-new features.

> **Project Overview:**
> Sim is a Turborepo monorepo with two deployable apps and a set of shared packages:
>
> - `apps/sim/` — the main Next.js application (App Router, ReactFlow, Zustand, Shadcn, Tailwind CSS).
> - `apps/realtime/` — a small Bun + Socket.IO server that powers the collaborative canvas. Shares DB and Better Auth secrets with `apps/sim` via `@sim/*` packages.
> - `apps/docs/` — Fumadocs-based documentation site.
> - `packages/` — shared workspace packages (`@sim/db`, `@sim/auth`, `@sim/audit`, `@sim/workflow-types`, `@sim/workflow-persistence`, `@sim/workflow-authz`, `@sim/realtime-protocol`, `@sim/security`, `@sim/logger`, `@sim/utils`, `@sim/testing`, `@sim/tsconfig`).
>
> Strict one-way dependency flow: `apps/* → packages/*`. Packages never import from apps. Please ensure your contributions follow this and our best practices for clarity, maintainability, and consistency.

## Local Development Setup

To set up your local development environment:

### Option 1: Using NPM Package (Simplest)

The easiest way to run Sim locally is using our NPM package:

```bash
npx simstudio
```

After running this command, open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser.

#### Options

- `-p, --port <port>`: Specify the port to run Sim on (default: 3000)
- `--no-pull`: Skip pulling the latest Docker images

#### Requirements

- Docker must be installed and running on your machine

### Option 2: Using Docker Compose

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sim.git
cd sim

# Start Sim
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Access the application at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

#### Using Local Models

To use local models with Sim:

1. Install Ollama and pull models:

   ```bash
   # Install Ollama (if not already installed)
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

   # Pull a model (e.g., gemma3:4b)
   ollama pull gemma3:4b
   ```

2. Start Sim with local model support:

   ```bash
   # With NVIDIA GPU support
   docker compose --profile local-gpu -f docker-compose.ollama.yml up -d

   # Without GPU (CPU only)
   docker compose --profile local-cpu -f docker-compose.ollama.yml up -d

   # If hosting on a server, update the environment variables in the docker-compose.prod.yml file
   # to include the server's public IP then start again (OLLAMA_URL to i.e. http://1.1.1.1:11434)
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

### Option 3: Using VS Code / Cursor Dev Containers

Dev Containers provide a consistent and easy-to-use development environment:

1. **Prerequisites:**

   - Visual Studio Code or Cursor
   - Docker Desktop
   - [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for VS Code

2. **Setup Steps:**

   - Clone the repository:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sim.git
     cd sim
     ```

   - Open the project in VS Code/Cursor.
   - When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" (or press F1 and select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container").
   - Wait for the container to build and initialize.

3. **Start Developing:**

   - Run `bun run dev:full` in the terminal or use the `sim-start` alias.
   - This starts both the main application and the realtime socket server.
   - All dependencies and configurations are automatically set up.
   - Your changes will be automatically hot-reloaded.

4. **GitHub Codespaces:**

   - This setup also works with GitHub Codespaces if you prefer development in the browser.
   - Just click "Code" → "Codespaces" → "Create codespace on staging".

### Option 4: Manual Setup

If you prefer not to use Docker or Dev Containers. **All commands run from the repository root unless explicitly noted.**

1. **Clone and Install:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sim.git
   cd sim
   bun install
   ```

   Bun workspaces handle dependency resolution for all apps and packages from the root `bun install`.

2. **Set Up Environment Files:**

   We use **per-app `.env` files** (the Turborepo-canonical pattern), not a single root `.env`. Three files are needed for local dev:

   ```bash
   # Main app — large, app-specific (OAuth secrets, LLM keys, Stripe, etc.)
   cp apps/sim/.env.example apps/sim/.env

   # Realtime server — small, only the values shared with the main app
   cp apps/realtime/.env.example apps/realtime/.env

   # DB tooling (drizzle-kit, db:migrate)
   cp packages/db/.env.example packages/db/.env
   ```

   At minimum, each `.env` needs `DATABASE_URL`. `apps/sim/.env` and `apps/realtime/.env` additionally need matching values for `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`. `apps/sim/.env` also needs `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `API_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Generate any 32-char secrets with `openssl rand -hex 32`.

   The same `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`, and `DATABASE_URL` must appear in both `apps/sim/.env` and `apps/realtime/.env` so the two services share auth and DB. After editing `apps/sim/.env`, you can mirror the shared subset into the realtime env in one shot:

   ```bash
   grep -E '^(DATABASE_URL|BETTER_AUTH_URL|BETTER_AUTH_SECRET|INTERNAL_API_SECRET|NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL|REDIS_URL)=' apps/sim/.env > apps/realtime/.env
   grep -E '^DATABASE_URL=' apps/sim/.env > packages/db/.env
   ```

3. **Run Database Migrations:**

   Migrations live in `packages/db/migrations/`. Run them via the dedicated workspace script:

   ```bash
   cd packages/db && bun run db:migrate && cd ../..
   ```

   For ad-hoc schema iteration during development you can also use `bun run db:push` from `packages/db`, but `db:migrate` is the canonical command for both local and CI/CD setups.

4. **Run the Development Servers:**

   ```bash
   bun run dev:full
   ```

   This launches both apps with coloured prefixes:

   - `[App]` — Next.js on `http://localhost:3000`
   - `[Realtime]` — Socket.IO on `http://localhost:6887`

   Or run them separately:

   ```bash
   bun run dev          # Next.js app only
   bun run dev:sockets  # realtime server only
   ```

5. **Make Your Changes and Test Locally.**

   Before opening a PR, run the same checks CI runs:

   ```bash
   bun run type-check   # TypeScript across every workspace
   bun run lint:check   # Biome lint across every workspace
   bun run test         # Vitest across every workspace
   ```

### Email Template Development

When working on email templates, you can preview them using a local email preview server:

1. **Run the Email Preview Server:**

   ```bash
   cd apps/sim && bun run email:dev
   ```

2. **Access the Preview:**

   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
   - You'll see a list of all email templates.
   - Click on any template to view and test it with various parameters.

3. **Templates Location:**

   - Email templates live in `apps/sim/components/emails/`.
   - Changes hot-reload automatically in the preview.

## Adding New Blocks and Tools

Sim is built in a modular fashion where blocks and tools extend the platform's functionality. To maintain consistency and quality, please follow the guidelines below when adding a new block or tool.

> **Use the skill guides for step-by-step recipes.** The repository ships opinionated, end-to-end guides under `.agents/skills/` that cover the exact file layout, conventions, registry wiring, and gotchas for each kind of contribution. Read the relevant SKILL.md before you start writing code:

### Where to Add Your Code

- **Blocks:** Create your new block file under the `apps/sim/blocks/blocks/` directory. The name of the file should match the provider name (e.g., `pinecone.ts`).
- **Tools:** Create a new directory under `apps/sim/tools/` with the same name as the provider (e.g., `apps/sim/tools/pinecone`).

In addition, you will need to update the registries:

- **Block Registry:** Add your block to `apps/sim/blocks/registry.ts`. (`apps/sim/blocks/index.ts` re-exports lookups from the registry; you do not need to edit it.)
- **Tool Registry:** Add your tool to `apps/sim/tools/index.ts`.

### How to Create a New Block

1. **Create a New File:**
   Create a file for your block named after the provider (e.g., `pinecone.ts`) in the `apps/sim/blocks/blocks/` directory.

2. **Create a New Icon:**
   Create a new icon for your block in `apps/sim/components/icons.tsx`. The icon should follow the same naming convention as the block (e.g., `PineconeIcon`).

3. **Define the Block Configuration:**
   Your block should export a constant of type `BlockConfig`. For example:

   ```typescript
   // apps/sim/blocks/blocks/pinecone.ts
   import { PineconeIcon } from '@/components/icons'
   import type { BlockConfig } from '@/blocks/types'
   import type { PineconeResponse } from '@/tools/pinecone/types'

   export const PineconeBlock: BlockConfig<PineconeResponse> = {
     type: 'pinecone',
     name: 'Pinecone',
     description: 'Use Pinecone vector database',
     longDescription: 'A more detailed description of what this block does and how to use it.',
     category: 'tools',
     bgColor: '#123456',
     icon: PineconeIcon,

     subBlocks: [
       {
         id: 'operation',
         title: 'Operation',
         type: 'dropdown',
         required: true,
         options: [
           { label: 'Generate Embeddings', id: 'generate' },
           { label: 'Search Text', id: 'search_text' },
         ],
         value: () => 'generate',
       },
       {
         id: 'apiKey',
         title: 'API Key',
         type: 'short-input',
         placeholder: 'Your Pinecone API key',
         password: true,
         required: true,
       },
     ],

     tools: {
       access: ['pinecone_generate_embeddings', 'pinecone_search_text'],
       config: {
         tool: (params: Record<string, any>) => {
           switch (params.operation) {
             case 'generate':
               return 'pinecone_generate_embeddings'
             case 'search_text':
               return 'pinecone_search_text'
             default:
               throw new Error('Invalid operation selected')
           }
         },
       },
     },

     inputs: {
       operation: { type: 'string', description: 'Operation to perform' },
       apiKey: { type: 'string', description: 'Pinecone API key' },
       searchQuery: { type: 'string', description: 'Search query text' },
       topK: { type: 'string', description: 'Number of results to return' },
     },

     outputs: {
       matches: { type: 'any', description: 'Search results or generated embeddings' },
       data: { type: 'any', description: 'Response data from Pinecone' },
       usage: { type: 'any', description: 'API usage statistics' },
     },
   }
   ```

4. **Register Your Block:**
   Add your block to the blocks registry (`apps/sim/blocks/registry.ts`):

   ```typescript
   // apps/sim/blocks/registry.ts
   import { PineconeBlock } from '@/blocks/blocks/pinecone'

   // Registry of all available blocks
   export const registry: Record<string, BlockConfig> = {
     // ... existing blocks
     pinecone: PineconeBlock,
   }
   ```

   The block will be automatically available to the application through the registry.

5. **Test Your Block:**
   Ensure that the block displays correctly in the UI and that its functionality works as expected.

### How to Create a New Tool

1. **Create a New Directory:**
   Create a directory under `apps/sim/tools/` with the same name as the provider (e.g., `apps/sim/tools/pinecone`).

2. **Create Tool Files:**
   Create separate files for each tool functionality with descriptive names (e.g., `fetch.ts`, `generate_embeddings.ts`, `search_text.ts`) in your tool directory.

3. **Create a Types File:**
   Create a `types.ts` file in your tool directory to define and export all types related to your tools.

4. **Create an Index File:**
   Create an `index.ts` file in your tool directory that imports and exports all tools:

   ```typescript
   // apps/sim/tools/pinecone/index.ts
   import { fetchTool } from './fetch'
   import { generateEmbeddingsTool } from './generate_embeddings'
   import { searchTextTool } from './search_text'

   export { fetchTool, generateEmbeddingsTool, searchTextTool }
   ```

5. **Define the Tool Configuration:**
   Your tool should export a constant with a naming convention of `{toolName}Tool`. The tool ID should follow the format `{provider}_{tool_name}`. For example:

   ```typescript
   // apps/sim/tools/pinecone/fetch.ts
   import { ToolConfig, ToolResponse } from '@/tools/types'
   import { PineconeParams, PineconeResponse } from '@/tools/pinecone/types'

   export const fetchTool: ToolConfig<PineconeParams, PineconeResponse> = {
     id: 'pinecone_fetch', // Follow the {provider}_{tool_name} format
     name: 'Pinecone Fetch',
     description: 'Fetch vectors from Pinecone database',
     version: '1.0.0',

     // OAuth configuration (if applicable)
     provider: 'pinecone', // ID of the OAuth provider

     params: {
       parameterName: {
         type: 'string',
         required: true,
         visibility: 'user-or-llm', // Controls parameter visibility
         description: 'Description of the parameter',
       },
       optionalParam: {
         type: 'string',
         required: false,
         visibility: 'user-only',
         description: 'Optional parameter only user can set',
       },
     },
     request: {
       // Request configuration
     },
     transformResponse: async (response: Response) => {
       // Transform response
     },
   }
   ```

6. **Register Your Tool:**
   Update the tools registry in `apps/sim/tools/index.ts` to include your new tool:

   ```typescript
   // apps/sim/tools/index.ts
   import { fetchTool, generateEmbeddingsTool, searchTextTool } from '@/tools/pinecone'
   // ... other imports

   export const tools: Record<string, ToolConfig> = {
     // ... existing tools
     pinecone_fetch: fetchTool,
     pinecone_generate_embeddings: generateEmbeddingsTool,
     pinecone_search_text: searchTextTool,
   }
   ```

7. **Test Your Tool:**
   Ensure that your tool functions correctly by making test requests and verifying the responses.

8. **Generate Documentation:**
   Run the documentation generator (from `apps/sim`) to create docs for your new tool:

   ```bash
   cd apps/sim && bun run generate-docs
   ```

### Naming Conventions

Maintaining consistent naming across the codebase is critical for auto-generation of tools and documentation. Follow these naming guidelines:

- **Block Files:** Name should match the provider (e.g., `pinecone.ts`)
- **Block Export:** Should be named `{Provider}Block` (e.g., `PineconeBlock`)
- **Icons:** Should be named `{Provider}Icon` (e.g., `PineconeIcon`)
- **Tool Directories:** Should match the provider name (e.g., `tools/pinecone/`)
- **Tool Files:** Should be named after their function (e.g., `fetch.ts`, `search_text.ts`)
- **Tool Exports:** Should be named `{toolName}Tool` (e.g., `fetchTool`)
- **Tool IDs:** Should follow the format `{provider}_{tool_name}` (e.g., `pinecone_fetch`)

### Parameter Visibility System

Sim implements a sophisticated parameter visibility system that controls how parameters are exposed to users and LLMs in agent workflows. Each parameter can have one of four visibility levels:

| Visibility    | User Sees | LLM Sees | How It Gets Set                |
| ------------- | --------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| `user-only`   | ✅ Yes    | ❌ No    | User provides in UI            |
| `user-or-llm` | ✅ Yes    | ✅ Yes   | User provides OR LLM generates |
| `llm-only`    | ❌ No     | ✅ Yes   | LLM generates only             |
| `hidden`      | ❌ No     | ❌ No    | Application injects at runtime |

#### Visibility Guidelines

- **`user-or-llm`**: Use for core parameters that can be provided by users or intelligently filled by the LLM (e.g., search queries, email subjects)
- **`user-only`**: Use for configuration parameters, API keys, and settings that only users should control (e.g., number of results, authentication credentials)
- **`llm-only`**: Use for computed values that the LLM should handle internally (e.g., dynamic calculations, contextual data)
- **`hidden`**: Use for system-level parameters injected at runtime (e.g., OAuth tokens, internal identifiers)

#### Example Implementation

```typescript
params: {
  query: {
    type: 'string',
    required: true,
    visibility: 'user-or-llm', // User can provide or LLM can generate
    description: 'Search query to execute',
  },
  apiKey: {
    type: 'string',
    required: true,
    visibility: 'user-only', // Only user provides this
    description: 'API key for authentication',
  },
  internalId: {
    type: 'string',
    required: false,
    visibility: 'hidden', // System provides this at runtime
    description: 'Internal tracking identifier',
  },
}
```

This visibility system ensures clean user interfaces while maintaining full flexibility for LLM-driven workflows.

### Guidelines & Best Practices

- **Code Style:** Follow the project's Biome configurations. Use meaningful variable names and small, focused functions.
- **Documentation:** Clearly document the purpose, inputs, outputs, and any special behavior for your block/tool.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and provide user-friendly error messages.
- **Parameter Visibility:** Always specify the appropriate visibility level for each parameter to ensure proper UI behavior and LLM integration.
- **Testing:** Add unit or integration tests to verify your changes when possible.
- **Commit Changes:** Update all related components and registries, and describe your changes in your pull request.

Happy coding!
